<h1 style="text-align: center;">Typescript: Beyond the core</h1>

----


## Context
This comprehensive guide aims to empower developers, including myself, in mastering both data structures/algorithms and Typescript.

The motivation behind creating this book is to facilitate a deep dive into the realms of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Advanced Backend Engineering.

The structured roadmap ensures a thorough exploration of each stage in the process, providing insights and knowledge for those transitioning from a basic understanding of Javascript.

**Note:** `The development of this book will be divided into stages (Edition 1, Edition 2, ...).`

**Note:** `Edition 1 will focus on the fundamentals of the language and data structures/Algorithms.`

## Contributions
During this stage, contributions may involve:
- Enhance the syllabus
- Correct mistakes in: [lecture content, exercises, resources, examples]
- Propose additional exercises and examples to augment the reader's understanding.
